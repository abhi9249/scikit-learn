Covariance estimation
---------------------
Estimation of covariance matrices then deals with the question of how to approximate the actual covariance matrix on the basis of a sample from
the multivariate distribution. ... Simple cases, where observations are complete, can be dealt with by using the sample covariance matrix.

Basically Co-variance tells us about the relationship between features of a dataset but does not give insight about the magnitude, 
For that purpose we use correlation.

Examples concerning the :mod:`sklearn.covariance` module.
